# RevShellGen
Yet another reverse shell generator for the CLI

About 76 shells included. Most are either publically available like from pentestmonkey or modified from their publically available form. A few are customized to work on all OS dynamically.

Usage:
```
python3 revshellgen.py -p (PORT) -i (IPADDRESS) -t (TYPE aka Programming Language)
```
or
```
python3 revshellgen.py -l
```

This was made with the goal of adding it to a different project of mine (https://github.com/V1236/Remy-Red-Team-Assistant) but its useful on its own without needing any changes.
